# It is always useful to know how to use a command. The following are very helpful:

man ls

ls --help

# Find out current directory

pwd

# Change directory 

cd ~/path/to/directory (the '~' indicates that the path is relative to the home directory. To find your home directory, run: env | grep HOME)

# Go up one directory

cd .. (you can also use this as a relative path for example to go up one directory and into another: cd ../sister_directory)

# list files in current directory

ls -l
